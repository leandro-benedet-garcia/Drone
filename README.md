# Drone
![code coverage badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leandro-benedet-garcia/Drone/gh-pages/code_coverage/badge_linecoverage.svg)

This is a mini application made in Unity version 2021.3.25f1. It has automated
tests, documentation and build entirely from github actions

The objective is to show a grid formed from an API and then allow the user to
input start coordinates where a drone would be located, a pickup point of the
material and the delivery point.

Since the API has no distance data and only time, we will need to use Dijkstras
pathfinding algorithm instead of A*.

* [Coverage Data](https://lag-killer-digital-entertainment.github.io/Drone/code_coverage/)
* [Game Build](https://Lag-Killer-Digital-Entertainment.github.io/Drone/build/) (I am doing this manually for now)

PS: I really like how I made a entire path finding system without ever using a
single `Update()`. I wonder if it would be possible to do a couple things without
`Start()` or `Awake()` but I see no reason why would someone do that
